# Predictive Scaling and Auto-Remediation Patterns

:::info Coming Soon
This document is currently being written. It will be updated soon.
:::

## Overview

Intelligently operating EKS clusters through proactive scaling using ML-based time series prediction and automated incident response.

## Topics to be Covered

- ML-based predictive autoscaling beyond HPA (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Karpenter + AI prediction-based proactive node scaling
- Automated incident response workflows (Runbooks + AI decision-making)
- AI-based resource rightsizing and cost optimization
- Building history-based feedback loops (improving prediction accuracy)
- Chaos Engineering + AI analysis (learning failure patterns)

# SageMaker-EKS Hybrid ML Architecture

:::info Coming Soon
This document is currently being written. It will be updated soon.
:::

## Overview

Designing a hybrid ML architecture that combines SageMaker's managed training environment with EKS's flexible serving infrastructure.

## Topics to be Covered

- Hybrid architecture design (SageMaker training + EKS serving)
- SageMaker Pipelines orchestration and EKS deployment triggers
- Centralized model governance (SageMaker Model Registry)
- Cost optimization strategies (separating training vs serving resources)
- Multi-region model deployment patterns
- Model monitoring and drift detection integration

# Building Intelligent Observability Stack for EKS

:::info Coming Soon
This document is currently being written. It will be updated soon.
:::

## Overview

Building an EKS observability architecture that combines OpenTelemetry Collector, CloudWatch AI, and DevOps Guru to provide ML-based anomaly detection and automated alerting.

## Topics to be Covered

- OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + ML anomaly detection integration architecture
- CloudWatch AI and CloudWatch Operator configuration (automated control plane metrics collection)
- DevOps Guru EKS integration (resource group-based ML analysis)
- ML-based alerting configuration and Alert Fatigue reduction strategies
- Context-aware anomaly detection (business metrics + infrastructure metrics correlation)
- Observability dashboards and SLO/SLI tracking

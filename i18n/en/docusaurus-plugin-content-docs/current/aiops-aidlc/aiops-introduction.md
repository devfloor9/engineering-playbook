# AIOps Introduction and EKS Application Strategy

:::info Coming Soon
This document is currently being written. It will be updated soon.
:::

## Overview

Understanding AIOps concepts and differences from traditional monitoring, covering strategies for applying AI-based observability and anomaly detection in EKS environments.

## Topics to be Covered

- AIOps definition and core capabilities (anomaly detection, auto-remediation, predictive analytics)
- Traditional monitoring vs AI-based observability comparison
- EKS-specific operational challenges (dynamic workloads, multi-tenancy, resource optimization)
- AIOps adoption decision framework and ROI evaluation
- AWS native AIOps services (DevOps Guru, CloudWatch AI)
- Open source AIOps toolchain (Prometheus + ML, Grafana ML)

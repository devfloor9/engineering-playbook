# EKS East-West Traffic Optimization Guide

> 📅 **Written**: 2026-02-09 | **Last Modified**: 2026-02-14 | ⏱️ **Reading Time**: ~3 min


When East-West (service-to-service) hops increase from 1 to 2, p99 latency increases by milliseconds, and crossing availability zones incurs AWS bandwidth charges ($0.01/GB). This article explores layer-by-layer options from Kubernetes-native features (Topology Hints, InternalTrafficPolicy) through Cilium ClusterMesh, AWS VPC Lattice, and Istio Ambient—comparing p99/p999 latency, CPU/memory overhead, and costs assuming 10 TB/month of same-AZ traffic.

## 2. Kubernetes Fundamentals Deep Dive

:::tip NodeLocal DNSCache Effect
Enabling NodeLocal DNSCache reduces cross-AZ DNS charges and latency.
:::

With NodeLocal DNSCache enabled, DNS queries are processed locally on nodes, reducing p99 lookup latency from several ms to sub-ms and alleviating CoreDNS QPS load.

## 3. AWS Internal Load Balancer Options Comparison

Using **IP targets** keeps LB→Pod traffic local to AZ, eliminating unnecessary cross-AZ charges.

## 6. 10 TB/Month East-West Traffic Cost Simulation

Assumption: Same region 3-AZ EKS cluster, total 10 TB (= 10,240 GB) service-to-service traffic.

Calculation:

- NLB / ALB processing charges approximated as 14.22 GB/h → NLCU or LCU * rate ($0.006 / $0.008)
- Cross-AZ unit price: $0.01 / GB (same region)

**Insights:**

- With InternalTrafficPolicy Local ensuring node-local, achieve **zero cost with lowest latency**. However, Pod Affinity configuration and proximity placement are required.
- With 20+ services and multi-account, Lattice provides operational convenience (with additional cost).
- ALB is best deployed as "spot" investment for specific paths needing L7 features/WAF, while maintaining ClusterIP path for remaining workloads—this **hybrid approach** is most economical for most workloads.

## 8. Architecture Selection Guide

1. **"Low Cost + Ultra-Low Latency"**: ClusterIP + Topology Hints (+ InternalTrafficPolicy Local if needed) + NodeLocal DNSCache.
2. **"L4 Stability and Fixed IP Required"**: NLB IP mode, but verify costs if traffic > 5 TB/month.
3. **"L7 Routing, WAF, gRPC Method-Level Control"**: Internal ALB + K8s Gateway API. Deploy only on required paths to prevent LCU increase.
4. **"Enterprise Zero-Trust, Multi-Cluster"**: Istio Ambient → transition sidecar to required workloads only.
5. **"Multi-Account, Services > 50"**: Managed Lattice + IAM policies to reduce network management complexity.

---

## 9. Conclusion

- In EKS, **network locality is the optimal path** for both performance and cost. Topology Aware Routing and IP-target LBs alone can reduce cross-AZ and DTO costs nearly to zero.
- To gain service mesh benefits (mTLS, traffic policy) while reducing overhead, evaluate the progression: **sidecar → node-proxy (Ambient) → sidecar-less (eBPF)**.
- Example: At 10 TB/month scale, ClusterIP-Local configuration saves **approximately $98 vs ALB and $400+ vs VPC Lattice**.

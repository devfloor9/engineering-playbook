## Overview

Deploying Kubeflow, MLflow, and KServe on EKS to automate end-to-end ML lifecycle from data preparation to model serving.

## Topics to be Covered

- End-to-end ML lifecycle architecture (data → training → serving)
- Data preparation and feature engineering (Kubeflow Pipelines)
- Experiment tracking and model registry (MLflow)
- Model serving strategies (KServe vs Seldon Core)
- CI/CD for ML: Argo Workflows + Kubeflow integration
- GPU resource scheduling and optimization
